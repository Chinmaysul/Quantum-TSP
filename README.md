# Quantum-TSP
The code consists of the Travelling Salesman Problem solved on a classical computer as well as a Quantum Computer
This was written in order to provide benchmarking of the TSP running on a Quantum and Classical Computer for my paper.
It also consists some additional codes for optimisation of routing for a TMS.
